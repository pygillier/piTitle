{"name":"Pititle","tagline":"Display image on your Raspberry Pi HDMI output using only your webserver.","body":"# piTitle\r\n\r\nA small raspberry-pi oriented project to display images on HDMI output through a webinterface.\r\n\r\n**WARNING :** This app must be used on a private lan and shouldn't be exposed on the internet as it requires privileges escalation \r\nto be useful. I can't find, atm, a simple way to use fbi from www-data user. If you know how, drop me a line !\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\nSetup has been tested on a raspberry pi 2 and a B+ one.\r\n\r\n### Requisites\r\n\r\n* lighttpd \r\n* PHP 5.4+\r\n* php_gd module\r\n* Composer\r\n* fbi (may work with fim)\r\n\r\n### fbi privileged access\r\nIn order to display images on HDMI output, fbi must be run with privileged access. Lots of tutorials exist on giving passwordless sudo to execute commands, check them.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nClone the repo anywhere on your PI, run `composer install` to install dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe `web` folder should be set as document root in lighttpd. \r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nIn `config` folder, copy file config.json.dist to config.json. Edit the file as you need.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
